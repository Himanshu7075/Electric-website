            <div class="service-para-content1-photo"></div>
            <div class="service-para-content1-text2">Battery-as-a-Service is a unique way that allows customers to keep their vehicles charged up and running, without having to worry about recharging drained-out batteries or replacing them. The concept enables customers to lease out batteries as a separate component from the car, on a subscription-based model, and swap it for a fully charged one as and when it depletes power.
            </div>
            <div class="service-para-content1-text2">The concept makes for a great first step, for both businesses and customers, toward sustainability. While battery-powered vehicles undoubtedly reduce fossil fuel consumption, the BaaS model further helps to offset carbon emissions, with solar-powered charge stations, shared mobility services, and more. As a result, the data-driven BaaS model adds potential for flexibility and scalability for businesses and fulfilling experiences for customers.

            <div class="service-para-content2-text1">What are the advantages of the Battery-as-a-Service Model?</div>
            <ul>BaaS makes for a perfect model for those who are always on the go.
            <li>Ready access to charged-up batteries, from intelligently set up swapping stations, ensures the availability of a reliable power source at all times.</li>
            <li>Customers aren't required to worry about the cost of buying or maintaining a battery.</li>
            <li>BaaS addresses incessant EV issues such as range anxiety and time-consuming charging process.</li>
            <li>Since the battery makes up for a considerable chink of the cost of an electric car (30-40%), the upfront buying costs go down.</li>
            <li>BaaS provides a solution for EV charging within city limits, for homes that do not have access to plug-in charge points.</li>
            <li>Car owners get the flexibility to choose from a variety of subscription plans, based on their dynamic usage trends, availability as well as driving behaviour.</li>
            <li>The BaaS model also brings down the cost of setting up a retail charging station for EVs, and instead relies on vehicular data to identify EV hot spots.</li>
